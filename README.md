## Features
This application provided following functionality:

    1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

    2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

    3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
